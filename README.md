# Advent of Code 2022: Day 9
Bart Massey

---

Part 1 was fairly straightforward, albeit with fiddly
rules.

Part 2 is another where my initial solution works for both
given examples but is too low for the problem input. I can't
tell you how frustrating that is: I have other things to do
this evening. I'll come back to this tomorrow and we'll see.
